## Application Purposes and Limitations

The Application was realized only for a didactic use, and it's not intended to be a complete file manager.

In fact, the following features are not available:
* Preview of zip archives content
* Access to SD Card or removable storages
* Access to root paths (root exlorer)

The Application has been developed to support devices with ```Android Sdk``` version >= 26 and <= 33 (the latest available during the develpment of the current version of the project); the Application could not work as expected on newer Android Sdk versions.
